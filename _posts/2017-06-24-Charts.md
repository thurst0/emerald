title: Dynamic Angular Charts
---

### In getting into [Angular Charts](http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/#top) I had a couple of goals.
1.) Come up with a dynamic way to load a variable amount of different types of charts.

> I later took this a step further, and using bootstrap displayed these in a dashboard configuration with variable amounts of rows and columns.
  
2.) Client side data aggregation using the data supplied to the charts.

> Using metadata, I was able to load multiple charts using database values.  The metadata supplys the data to aggregate, and aggregate by.
