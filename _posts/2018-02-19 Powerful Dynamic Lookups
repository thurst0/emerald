title: Powerful Dynamic Lookups
---

### Project summary
Come up with a dynamic screen and set of components to use for looking up and returning data
### Project goals
1.) This had to be capable of handling large amounts of data.  This ruled out all of the options out there with limited flexibility in that area. 
I checked out selectize, select 2, etc.

*I ended up using a combination of a component called ui-grid, and basic bootstrap form controls.  I was able to homeroll from there.
Check out an example in [plunkr](https://plnkr.co/edit/WJssKB)
